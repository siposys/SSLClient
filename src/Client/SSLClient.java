             * the security attributes.
             *
             * SSL handshaking can be initiated by either flushing data
             * down the pipe, or by starting the handshaking by hand.
             *
             * Handshaking is started manually in this example because
             * PrintWriter catches all IOExceptions (including
             * SSLExceptions), sets an internal error flag, and then
             * returns without rethrowing the exception.
             *
             * Unfortunately, this means any error messages are lost,
             * which caused lots of confusion for others using this
             * code.  The only way to tell there was an error is to call
             * PrintWriter.checkError().
